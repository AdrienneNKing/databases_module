  3. integer/date
  4. float
  5. float

2)  A database is used when it is necessary to store large amounts of data that can be quickly read and modified. A text file would be used
when it is necessary for the data to be easily readable.

3) One difference between SQL and other programming languages is that SQL is declarative rather than procedural language, meaning we leave it
to the database to feed us the information rather than defining how it should do that.

4) The pieces of a database fit together at a high level much like an excel table, where there are column titles that define a relationship
with the subsequent data-filled cells underneath. We use these titles to access the data through SQL queries.

5) A table is the database as an entire object, a row is a horizontal subset of the data, wherein each intersecting column's cells can be accessed. A column
is a subset of the data, wherein each intersecting row's cells can be accessed. Value refers to the data within each individual cell, which is itself the
exact intersection of a specific column and row.

6) A string, integer, or float can be stored in a table.

7)
a)
This SQL query tells the payments database to return the values of all cells with the column title "date" and the column title " amount" in a new table.

That new table would be:

date	amount
2016-05-01T00:00:00.000Z	1500.0000
2016-05-10T00:00:00.000Z	37.0000
2016-05-15T00:00:00.000Z	124.9300
2016-05-23T00:00:00.000Z	54.7200

b)
This SQL query tells the payments database to return the value of all cells with the column title "amount", where the value of that cell is greater than
500, in a new table.

That new table would be:

amount
1500.0000

c)
This SQL query tells the payments database to select all available columns with the payee designated as "Mega Foods", and return them
in a new table.

That new table would be:

date	payee	amount	memo
2016-05-15T00:00:00.000Z	Mega Foods	124.9300	Groceries

8)

a)
SELECT email, signup
FROM users
WHERE name = 'DeAndre Data';

returns
email	signup
datad@comcast.net	2008-01-20T00:00:00.000Z

b)
SELECT userid
FROM users
WHERE email = 'aleesia.algorithm@uw.edu';

returns
userid
1

c)
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE userid = 4;

returns
userid	name	email	signup
4	Brandy Boolean	bboolean@nasa.gov	1999-10-15T00:00:00.000Z
